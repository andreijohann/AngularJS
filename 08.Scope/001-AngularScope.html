AngularJS Scope

The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).
The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.
The scope is available for both the view and the controller.

Understanding the Scope
If we consider an AngularJS application to consist of:

View, which is the HTML.
Model, which is the data available for the current view.
Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.
Then the scope is the Model.

The scope is a JavaScript object with properties and methods, which are available for both the view and the controller.

-> Root Scope
All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.
The rootScope is available in the entire application.
If a variable has the same name in both the current scope and in the rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope.
-->
<body ng-app="myApp">

<p>The rootScope's favorite color:</p>
<h1>{{color}}</h1>

<div ng-controller="myCtrl">
    <p>The scope of the controller's favorite color:</p>
    <h1>{{color}}</h1>
</div>

<p>The rootScope's favorite color is still:</p>
<h1>{{color}}</h1>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.run(function($rootScope) {
    $rootScope.color = 'blue';
});
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.color = "red";
});
</script>

</body>
