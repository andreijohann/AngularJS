<!-- 
Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.

Data Model
AngularJS applications usually have a data model. The data model is a collection of data available for the application.

HTML View
The HTML container where the AngularJS application is displayed, is called the view.

The view has access to the model, and there are several ways of displaying model data in the view.

You can use the ng-bind directive, which will bind the innerHTML of the element to the specified model property
-->
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
    <p ng-bind="firstname"></p>
</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.firstname = "Andrei";
    $scope.lastname = "Johann";    
});
</script>
</body>
